# Release 1.19-RC1

This release 1.19 extends the work on the support of data quality checks. This new release introduces the support of tests around referential integrity. You can now assert if a result-set has all its foreign-keys pointing to a reference result-set (or the other way). Also interesting to note that we're expanding the usage of variables, they are now usable in more places and can be overridden in the configuration file. Another new feature, to be develop further in the next releases, is the scoring of a result-set. This feature lets you define a percentage of quality, clearly stating if a result-set is fit for purpose or not, in place of reporting a number of rows violating a predicate.
