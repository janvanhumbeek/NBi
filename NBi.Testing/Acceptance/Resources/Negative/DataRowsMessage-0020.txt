  Expected: all rows validate the predicate '#0 is more than 20.'. 
  But was:  2 rows don't validate the predicate '#0 is more than 20.'.


Actual result-set returned by the query:
Result-set with 3 rows

     #0 (Column0)
     ------------ 
     5           
     15          
     25          



Rows not validating the predicate:
Result-set with 2 rows

     #0 (Column0)
     ------------ 
     5           
     15
